# OpcUaTestClient
OPC UA Client test console application, using [One-Way Automation C++ OPC UA SDK](https://github.com/onewayautomation/1WaOpcUaSdk).

## How to build on Windows.
It is assumed that source code repository base folder is at RepoBaseFolder.

> Please note that currently binaries for the OPC UA SDK are created only for VC++ 2017, 64 bit debug and release modes.
If you need SDK binaries for other targets (not only VC++, any other target like Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi), please create an issue or contact us.

### Install prerequisites
- Install **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017**. Free Community edition is sufficient. Note that component **Desktop development with C++** should be selected in Visual Studio Installer, and installed.
Please also note that scripts which build dependencies, have path to the **vcvarsall.bat** file, which prepares environment to build C++ code, set for Community edition of Visual Studio (**C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build**). If you have Enterprise or Professional version, please adjust path in the **build-botan.bat** file.
- Install **Python 2.7** and add path to it into the **Path** environment variable; 
- Install **nasm** (download from http://www.nasm.us, and add path to it into Path environment variable;)
- **git** should be availabe from Windows command line console, together with git shell sh.exe.
### Clone and build dependencies
- Open command line console and go to the folder RepoBaseFolder/OpcUaTestClient 
- Run script **install-dependencies.cmd** This can take for a while (around 15 minutes) to pull source code and build all the dependencies.
### Build OpcUaTestClient
  Open solution RepoBaseFolder/OpcUaTestClient/OpcUatestClient.sln with Visual Studio 2017 and build the solution.
  
 >Please note that at the very first run of the built application it will take some time to create CA certificate and Application Instance Certificate.
